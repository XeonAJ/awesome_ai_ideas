# The "AI Project Idea" repo! üí°üí°üí°
### A collection of ideas for kick-starting your AI Project journey! <br>

Remember, you can never win a big hackathon by just implementing these ideas. You need to be creative, original and hunt for the root cause and then make a solution. Try walking in the end users shoe to understand the problems we could face over time.

Here's a tip, pick a idea try modifying it or try to find a MVP which can be built using it. (MVP - Minimum Value Project)

A Majority of hackathon winners create a business model in there submission. In lay mans term a project with some business value will always have a high chance of winnning than others. Try to make the project portable and end-to-end deployable when asked.
